In today’s connected world, **security is no longer optional**.

If you're building websites, apps, or APIs — you are already in the cybersecurity battlefield.

Here’s why you should write code like a hacker is watching:

- SQL injections happen when form inputs aren’t sanitized
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) can steal cookies and sessions
- Weak JWT secrets can be brute-forced in minutes

> Security isn’t an add-on — it’s a core user experience feature.

Building with **secure-by-design** principles makes your portfolio professional and your client websites resilient.

When you think like a hacker, your code becomes airtight.

**Pro tip:** Always validate inputs on the server side, even if they’ve been validated on the client.

This case study shows how we helped a local business **triple** their traffic and **double** conversions in 60 days.

The business had:
- An outdated WordPress site
- No mobile responsiveness
- Broken contact forms
- No SEO or tracking tools

Here’s what we did:

1. Rebuilt the site using modern, fast-loading React + TailwindCSS
2. Added analytics, search console, and live chat
3. Implemented SEO best practices and schema markup
4. Hardened the site with HTTPS, CSP headers, and security patches

The results:

- Bounce rate dropped by 42%
- Daily traffic went from 120 to 400+
- Leads converted into real sales through better UX

> **Lesson:** A modern, secure, fast website isn’t optional anymore — it’s your business’s growth engine.

If your business site hasn’t been updated in 2+ years, it’s time to fix that now.
